# Assalam-U-Alaikum — I'm Aaliyan Ahmed

I provide optimized solutions and production-ready pipelines in Generative AI (GENAI), Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and video analytics. My work focuses on measurable system improvements: reduced inference time, lower resource consumption, predictable behavior, and clear operational handover for engineering teams.

## What I deliver

- Production-ready AI systems and pipelines for GENAI, ML, Computer Vision, and video analytics optimized for latency, throughput, and cost.
- Reproducible workflows: data ingestion → preprocessing → training → evaluation → inference → monitoring.
- Deployable services (APIs, containers, orchestration) tuned for target workloads and failure modes.
- Documentation, operational runbooks, and handover artefacts for engineering teams.

## Core areas

- Computer Vision
  - Object detection, instance segmentation, multi-camera tracking, and action recognition.
  - Video analytics (surveillance use cases) implemented as part of computer vision systems: stream ingestion, frame sampling, detection → tracking → alerting, with configurable privacy and data‑retention controls.
  - Production considerations: model pruning and quantization, batching, asynchronous processing, and efficient use of accelerators to meet latency and resource objectives.
  - Operational notes: clear evaluation metrics, documented failure modes, and runbooks so teams can operate and extend the system.

- Generative & Multimodal AI
  - Image captioning, multimodal retrieval, prompt-guided generation, and integration of GENAI components into pipelines with attention to latency and cost.
  - Designs that balance model capability with operational constraints and expected workload.

- Machine Learning Engineering & Optimization
  - Data validation, feature pipelines, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning focused on production applicability.
  - Performance profiling and targeted optimizations for I/O, data pipelines, and model serving.

- MLOps & Deployment
  - Containerized APIs (FastAPI), message brokers (RabbitMQ/Kafka), and orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes.
  - CI/CD for models and infrastructure, model versioning, staged rollouts, monitoring, and alerting.
  - Resource and cost planning for multi-tenant or multi-client environments.

- Agentic Systems
  - Design of agents that execute task sequences, handle expected failure modes, and apply model outputs within defined safeguards.

## Typical engagement flow
1. Define objectives and KPIs (latency, throughput, accuracy, cost).  
2. Prototype and measure baseline performance.  
3. Optimize models and pipelines (compression, batching, I/O improvements).  
4. Harden production behaviors (logging, retries, isolation, access controls).  
5. Deploy and operate with monitoring and model lifecycle management.

## Surveillance & Video Analytics — practical notes
- Systems designed to process live streams or stored video at scale, balancing detection rate, false positives, and compute cost.
- Common optimizations:
  - Frame skipping and adaptive sampling based on scene dynamics.
  - Edge preprocessing to reduce bandwidth and cloud compute.
  - Quantized or lower-precision models for edge inference.
  - Partitioning pipeline stages across devices and services to reduce end-to-end latency.
- Deployments include privacy-by-design considerations and configurable retention policies.

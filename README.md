👋 Hey there!

I'm Aaliyan Ahmed, an AI Engineer & MLOps Architect, passionate about building scalable, production-grade AI systems. I specialize in crafting intelligent solutions across Computer Vision, AI Workflows, Generative AI, and Agentic AI, integrating robust backend infrastructure and real-time performance.

🚀 What I Build:

→ Advanced Computer Vision Systems: Real-time spatial understanding, activity analysis, object tracking, and scene intelligence

→ AI Workflows: End-to-end automation pipelines—from data ingestion and training to inference, monitoring, and deployment

→ Generative AI: Systems for content generation, image captioning, multimodal reasoning, and creative automation

→ Agentic AI: Autonomous, context-aware agents capable of multi-step reasoning, task delegation, and decision-making

→ Deployment Architectures: Production-grade setups using Docker, FastAPI, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and edge inference

→ MCP (Model Context Protocol): Integration of context-driven, multi-client AI services


🤝 Let’s Collaborate On:

Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Computer Vision | NLP | MLOps | Generative AI | Agentic AI | Scalable AI Pipelines | Real-Time Intelligent Systems | MCP-Integrated Workflows

Assalam-U-Alaikum, I’m Aaliyan Ahmed

AI Engineer & MLOps Architect

I build and deploy AI systems that actually work in the real world — fast, reliable, and scalable. My focus is on making AI practical: systems that solve problems, automate processes, and deliver value at scale.

🌟 What I Do

Computer Vision – I build end-to-end Computer Vision solutions — from image recognition to large-scale video intelligence

AI Pipelines – End-to-end workflows: data prep, model training, inference, evaluation, and deployment.

Generative & Multimodal AI – AI that can describe images, create content, and reason across text + visuals.

Agentic AI – Intelligent agents that make decisions, complete tasks, and interact with people and environments.

MLOps & Deployment – Scalable microservices with FastAPI, Docker, RabbitMQ/Kafka, and MCP for multi-client use.

🔑 My Approach

I care about clarity, reliability, and performance. Every system I design is built to be understandable, maintainable, and production-ready — whether it’s a computer vision pipeline or a multi-agent workflow.

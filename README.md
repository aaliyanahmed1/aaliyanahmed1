Assalam-U-Alaikum — I’m Aaliyan Ahmed
AI Engineer & MLOps Architect 

I design, build, and deploy scalable, production-grade AI systems that solve real-world problems through automation, intelligence, and performance optimization. With a strong foundation in Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Agentic AI, I specialize in delivering end-to-end AI pipelines that are fast, resilient, and enterprise-ready.

💡 Core Expertise
🔹 Real-Time Computer Vision
From motion detection to multi-object tracking and spatial analytics—I've architected vision pipelines capable of understanding and reacting to dynamic environments with high accuracy and low latency.

🔹 AI Workflow Engineering
I design complete AI pipelines including data preprocessing, model training, inference, evaluation, and CI/CD deployment. My stacks integrate FastAPI, Docker, RabbitMQ, and GPU/Edge inference seamlessly.

🔹 Generative AI & Multimodal Systems
Built systems for image captioning, content generation, and multimodal reasoning using models like Florence-2 and GIT. I enable creativity and automation through AI-powered storytelling and content workflows.

🔹 Agentic AI Systems
I develop autonomous agents that perform multi-step reasoning, task orchestration, and real-time decisions—enabling intelligent interaction between users, environments, and data.

🔹 MLOps & Deployment Architectures
Specializing in Dockerized microservices, FastAPI-based APIs, message brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka), and context-aware services using MCP (Model Context Protocol) for multi-client scalability.
